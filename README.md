# Artof Comments

This is a Joomla 2.5/3 plugin that provides Discus support for articles. 

Most other plugins use a complicated system of manually adding article or category id's to white or black list fields. This plugin actually hooks into the article and category edit forms to provide a new "Enable Comments" option.

You can download in the Joomla installable package from [http://www.theartofjoomla.com/extensions/artof-comments.html](http://www.theartofjoomla.com/extensions/artof-comments.html)

The source code is made available under the GPL version 2+ (when used by or with the Joomla CMS) or the MIT license (when not used by or with the Joomla CMS).

## Changelog

### Version 1.1 - 15 January 2013

* Removed "Use Global" option in the category options. The default setting is now "No" (not enabled).
* Changed text of "Use Global" option in the article options to "Use category setting" (this is the default).
* Added option to show a "Jump to Comments" link before the body of the content.
* Restricted the display of the Disqus form to an article page only (not overly happy with the way this is done, but the best I can do at the moment).
* Added update server.
* Changed zip from a single plugin to a package to make it easy to add other things in the future (like a module).

### Version 1.0 - December 2012

Initial release.
