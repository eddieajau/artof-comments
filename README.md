# Artof Comments

This is a Joomla 2.5/3 plugin that provides Discus support for articles. 

Most other plugins use a complicated system of manually adding article or category id's to white or black list fields. This plugin actually hooks into the article and category edit forms to provide a new "Enable Comments" option.
